## Context
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most frequent cause of death. The figures speak for themselves: about 18 million people died from CVDs in 2019, and 20.5 million in 2021, accounting for almost a third of all global death. Furthermore, the numbers are increasing rapidly, with a 70% rise since 1990 (12 million CVD deaths).
The detection of cardiovascular disease is crucial in helping patient and hindering the disease by proposing proper treatment. Thankfully, there are widely accepted clinical indicators for potential risk of contracting a cardio-vascular sickness. Measuring and classifying these features can therefore help determine the risk of a patient to be subject to CVDs. This is what we will be focusing on.
Description of the dataset
Our dataset, named SAHeart.csv, was obtained from the Coronary Risk Factor Study conducted in South Africa by Rousseauw et al. in 1983. It aims to use a set of indicators to determine whether a patient has a risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases. The study focused on white males aged 15 to 64. There are 462 observations in total, with 160 individuals (~35%) experiencing myocardial infarction (class “1” in chd) at the time of the surveys, while the rest did not suffer from such a disease.
